This way, you are not attempting to capture the highs and lows of the market but rather the cost of your investment is averaged over a period. The essence of SIPs is that when the markets fall, investors automatically acquire more units. Likewise, they acquire lesser units when the market rises. This means that you buy less when the price is high whereas you buy more when the price is low. Hence, the average cost per unit drops down over time."," A Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) gives flexibility, long-term gains, regular saving, convenience, and investment starting as low as Rs. 500/Month."]
